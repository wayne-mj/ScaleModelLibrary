## Scale Model Library

### Background

This library was originally a collection of spread sheets that were created to convert from imperial measurements to metric for modelling.

The spread sheet included tables for HO, OO, and user scale:
- Ruler measurements with increments from 1/16th to 1/4 of an inch between 0 and 12 inches,
- Lookup table for range between 0' 0" to 10' 11 63/64"
- A generated lookup tables up to 36", 48" and 96"

Other spread sheets were added as the need arose including some based on trig points for planning where track curves were to be located, proof formula if a locomotive or piece of rolling stock was going to be supported by a curve or series of curves, calculation requirements for a helix, and the odd will it just plain fit table.
